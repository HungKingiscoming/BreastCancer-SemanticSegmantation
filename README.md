  In recent years, deep learning-based semantic segmentation has demonstrated remarkable potential in medical image analysis, especially in accurately outlining cancer boundaries in ultrasound images.
</div>  
<div align="justify">
  Therefore, we suggest some methods can deal with those tasks by comparing six semantic segmentation models—UNet, PSPNet, DeepLabV3+, TransUNet, Swin-Unet, and SegFormer—using two benchmark datasets: BUSI and BUS-WHU.

### How semantics segmentation deals with those problems
<div align="justify">
  Breast cancer is currently one of the most life-threatening cancers diagnosed and continues to rise in prevalence worldwide.
</div>  
<div align="justify">
  Early detection plays a crucial role in reducing mortality and improving patient outcomes (Crosby et al., 2022). With advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), semantic segmentation has become a promising technique for breast cancer detection
</div>  
<div align="justify">
  A wide range of semantic segmentation models, particularly those based on deep learning, have been introduced (Hu et al., 2020).
</div>  
<div align="justify">
  However, most of these models were originally developed for general object detection tasks—such as identifying vehicles or animals—and have seen limited application in the context of breast cancer.
</div>  
<div align="justify">
  To address this gap, this study aims to evaluate and analyze the performance of deep learning-based semantic segmentation models on breast cancer datasets, with the goal of identifying the most effective architecture for accurate detection.
</div>  
   
<div align="justify">
  In this subsection, we use two different datasets of breast ultrasound images to evaluate semantic segmentation models,
namely the Breast Ultrasound Images (BUSI) and the Breast Cancer Ultrasound Image (BUSI_WHU).
</div>  
<div align="justify">
  Both of those datasets are published and dowloaded through <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aryashah2k/breast-ultrasound-images-dataset">Breast Ultrasound Images (BUSI)</a> and <a href="https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/k6cpmwybk3/1">Breast Cancer Ultrasound Image (BUSI_WHU)</a>.
