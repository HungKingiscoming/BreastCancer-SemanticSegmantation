  In recent years, deep learning-based semantic segmentation has demonstrated remarkable potential in medical image analysis, especially in accurately outlining cancer boundaries in ultrasound images.

  Therefore, we suggest some methods can deal with those tasks by comparing six semantic segmentation models—UNet, PSPNet, DeepLabV3+, TransUNet, Swin-Unet, and SegFormer—using two benchmark datasets: BUSI and BUS-WHU.
